# Button
Use buttons for actions that affect the website's front-end or back-end.
Use the appropriate variant for your intent.

<Primary />

## Props
<Controls />

## Button Text
Label button actions clearly and accurately. Begin with actionable verbs.
<br/>

## Button Icons
A button may have one or two icons associated with the text.

If one icon is declared, its position can be declared using `iconPlacement` with options of 'start' and 'end'. 

If there are two icons, they must be comma-delimited in order to take affect.

Their placement before or after the button text is determined by the order in which they are declared.

For instance, `iconNames="home,star"` would show the home icon before the button text, and the star icon after the button text.

To change the placement of those icons, simply change the order of declaration: `iconNames="home,star"`.

## Variants
`Primary` - Use a primary button to highlight the most important call to action in an experience.
Use them sparingly, at most once in a container, to avoid making the interface too busy.  If no variant is provided, the Button will default to this look and feel.

`Secondary` - Use secondary buttons alongside a primary button to provide alternative actions on a page.

`Control` - Use control buttons for actions like toggling audio on/off, closing modals and dialogs, and controlling video playback.

`Disabled` - Occurs when state of any button is set to 'disabled'. 

`Critical` - Destructive. Use for actions that delete, disconnect, or perform an action the user cannot undo.
